# Project Plan -- SyncSlide
## Project Overview
### Summary
SyncSlide is a presentation tool designed to create simple, accessible, live slides that can be viewed from any device with a web browser. It aims to address the accessibility issues faced by individuals with print disabilities in academic settings, conferences, and business presentations.
### Objective
To develop an alternative presentation software that allows users of assistive technologies (screen readers, specialized fonts, colour inversion, etc.) to follow along with presentations effortlessly.
### Scope
Development of a web-based presentation tool incorporating accessibility features and real-time content updates.
### Stakeholders
* Project Owner: Melody Shih
* Sponsor: NextGen
* Other: Users with print disabilities, presenters, accessibility advocates

### Goals
* Create a user-friendly presentation tool that supports assistive technologies.
* Ensure real-time updates and ease of use for presenters.
* Expand accessibility features to include audience interaction tools and accessible graphics.
* Provide support for diverse content types such as math equations.
